    <h1>ECHS High Altitude Balloon Project</h1>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>The goal of our project was to design launch a high altitude weather balloon containing a scientific experiment and sensors, in order to measure atmospheric data. To do this we split into a media team, and engineering team, and a science team.</p>
  <p>The Engineering team was tasked with building the sensors that would go up in the balloon. This involved soldering many different components together as well as writing code to collect data on the atmosphere as the balloon ascended.<p>
  <h1>Materials & Procedures</h1>
  <p>Our largest task was designing circuitry and code which would let us collect accurate atmospheric data. Our materials consisted of a a pressure sensor, an accelerometer, and a thermometer. Our first steps were to set up all the sensors, to ensure they worked as individual units. To do this we connected them to an arduino, and used custom packages to read the data. Once all sensors were working individually, we connected them in an integrated system. We connected all of the circuitry on a breadboard, and made the code more modular so that it could all operate in once piece. Once the design was finalized, we soldered it together on a breadboard. We also needed a method to store the data. In order to do that, we connected an SD card to the Arduino.</p>
  <h1>Results</h1>
  <p>After parsing through the data we gathered from the flight, we realized that unfortunately, the sensors stopped giving data around 3 and a third hours into the flight, before the balloon reached its peak altitude. However, we did gather quite a lot of data, which you can see in the graphs below. We can see the pressure and temperature gradually decrease, and the acceleration (once launched) stayed pretty constant, as we the data doesnâ€™t go far enough to reach the descent of the balloon, where we would see a spike in the acceleration. </p>
